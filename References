My notes about the fleapower script:
https://github.com/fleapower/Google-Script-Contacts-Sync/issues/19


When starting a new Connections query and you don't have a synctoken -- i.e. you're going to request All contacts:
1. First script run will query with no synctoken and no pagetoken.
Process as many contacts and pages as you can, and save nextPageToken but no synctoken.
2. Second run of the script will run the same query again, with no synctoken still, but this time populate pagetoken.
3. Keep iterating the script until you get no nextpagetoken and you do get a nextSyncToken. Now you know you've finished all Contacts.

Now for future syncs, you want to only get updated contacts. So:
4. On the first run, populate syncToken (with nextSyncToken value from previous), and no pageToken.
5. On iterations, use the same syncToken and the saved pageToken.
